Instructions:

Using the data in the ./data/jsons file, we create a baseline model by counting the number of times a source shows up, the aggregate numeric bias of a given source, and the number of times each bias type shows up in a source. A potential problem is that almost every article from the same source shares the same bias. For example, Politico has 2493 articles and all of them are ranked as having left bias.
